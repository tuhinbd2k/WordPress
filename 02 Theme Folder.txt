02 Theme Folder
=========================


2.1 Theme Folder Creation:
We've to create a theme folder with the name of our new theme like "mytheme" at the following 
Location:

Root-Directory > wp-content\themes\


2.2 Theme File Creation:
We've to create three (3) files under "mytheme" to recognize and activate the "mytheme" folder as a theme 
directory by WordPress, those files are as follows:

a. Index File  -> index.php
b. Style Sheet -> style.css
c. Thumbnail   -> screenshort.png

File name should be the same as stated above (spelling and small character).


2.3 The style.css File:
We've to write the following codes as comments in the "style.css" file for a valid CSS file to make the 
theme:

/*
Theme Name: My Theme
Theme URI: http:/www.mytheme.com
Author: Atiqur Rahman Tuhin
Author URI: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuhinbd2k/
Version: 1.0
Description: This is a Test Theme.
*/


2.4 The screenshot.png file:
We've to make a "screenshot.png" to view a thumbnail of the theme. The dimension should be 600px X 450px 
(width X height) exactly. We can make it in jpg format also.
